# Basic Observations about Legged Animals

This starts with the physics and mechanics.

In _Symmetrical Gaits of Horses_, we can see that there are so many different gaits of horses \(100+\), much more that those we use in quadruped robots. It's hard to memorize so many gaits without a task in mind.

In _Gait and the energetics of locomotion in horses_, the amazing two-fold conclusion is: horses choose the energetically optimal gait and achieve an optimal energy consumption rate \(over distance\) which is almost a constant value regardless of the change in gaits; in each gait, however, the curve can be fitted by a parabolic curve.
