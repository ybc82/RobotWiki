# Standing

## *Human balance and posture control during standing and walking* 

This is a review paper on human balance control. The purpose of this review is "to introduce the reader to the basic anatomy, mechanics, and neuromuscular control that is seen in the current literature related to balance control".

This paper was written in 1995 (Canada), yet already considering problems in dealing with aging population.

### Definitions

These terms are different:

- COM: Center of mass
- COG: The vertical projection of the COM onto the ground
- COP: Center of Pressure. This represents the point location of the VERTICAL ground reaction force vector. Unless the system is static, it doesn't have to be the same as COG.

And by modeling we find out that the difference between the COP and COM is proportional to the horizontal acceleration of the COM. (Inverted pendulum model)
