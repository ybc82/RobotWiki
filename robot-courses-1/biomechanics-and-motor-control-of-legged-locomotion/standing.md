## _Human balance and posture control during standing and walking_

This is a review paper on human balance control. The purpose of this review is "to introduce the reader to the basic anatomy, mechanics, and neuromuscular control that is seen in the current literature related to balance control".

This paper was written in 1995 \(Canada\), yet already considering problems in dealing with aging population.

### Definitions

These terms are different:

* COM: Center of mass
* COG: The vertical projection of the COM onto the ground
* COP: Center of Pressure. This represents the point location of the VERTICAL ground reaction force vector. Unless the system is static, it doesn't have to be the same as COG.

And by modeling, we find out that the difference between the COP and COM is proportional to the horizontal acceleration of the COM. \(Inverted pendulum model\)

Assumption: $$z \equiv z_0$$ï¼Œat least within second order. Consider this as very motion in z-axis.

Thus, the Linear Inverted Pendulum Plus Flywheel Model looks like a LIPM plus a joint servo model.

When computing the Capture Point: 

* Step I, calculate without controlling the flywheel, i.e. $$\tau_h = 0$$. Use Orbital Energy for analysis, which remains CONSTANT within one step. Orbital Energy of zero leads to a stable step. So, $$x_{capture}=\dot{x} \sqrt{\frac{z_0}{g}}$$. _When the flywheel is made available, this point will grow to Capture Region_. The optimal trajectory turns into an optimal region.
