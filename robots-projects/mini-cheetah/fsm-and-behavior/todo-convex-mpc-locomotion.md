# \[TODO] Convex MPC Locomotion

"With the simplified model, ground reaction force planning problems are formulated for prediction horizons of up to 0.5 seconds, and are solved to optimality in under 1 ms at a rate of 20-30 Hz."

## Library

JCQP: implements a Judicious and Clear Quadratic Program solver.
