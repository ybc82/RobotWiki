# Welcome Page

I'm an engineer in the field of robotics. I'm interested in dynamics and control, localization, formation control, etc.. I've worked in the fields of drones, bio-inspired robots, and mobiles robots (AGVs).

This site is designed to document courses, projects, and techniques related to robotics technology.

The style of this site is sort of like personal documents. But sharing it publicly should help the readers and also encourage me on better writing and formatting.

Feel free to contact me at yubocheng@live.cn
