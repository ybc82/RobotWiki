# Grasp & Manipulation

## Robotic Grasping by Dr. Miao Li

[Section I](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/21650364?refer=cobot); Section II

Quote: "Grasping is solved", which is not true.

Fundamental questions:

(1) How to grasp (Grasp Planning): Multi-contact planning. 'Force-closure' -- comparable to stability in control.

(2) How to control (Grasp Control): Respond compliantly to dynamic changes of the environment. Force-control, tactile control, impedance control, etc.

(3) How to manipulate (Dexterous Manipulation): Manipulation robustly under constraint

Why is Robotic Grasping important: it's a great minimal example to include all branches of robotics; it's the bridge to bring robots into our real life.

* Dexterity: How can we plan and execute dexterous skills that coordinate motion, force, and compliant multi-contact behaviors?
* Interaction: How can we model and respond to the constrained physical interactions?
